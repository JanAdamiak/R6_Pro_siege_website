# R6_Pro_siege_website
Website with stats of professional players at pro tournaments in a video game!

I've obtained most of the [data](https://github.com/JanAdamiak/R6_Pro_siege_website/blob/master/ProLeagueStats.ipynb) I wanted!

To get more data that I'm looking for, I would have to manually watch all the matches and input all the data myself.

I've done an initial look into the stats in Jupyter notebooks.

Next steps are: decent back-end engine in Django, make the website look okay with my limited front-end skills!
